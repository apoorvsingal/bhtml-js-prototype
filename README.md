# BHTML

A compact, memory efficient and way faster to parse, binary format for HTML.

The format is a just a small demonstration for how much scope for optimisations the web has. I wonder why something like this isn't an integrated part of webkit in the first place.

The only possible use case of it I can think of is in places like hot reloading where it can be used as compression algorithm to lower the page size by a lot (really lot).

A similar approach can be used to have an even more compact and efficient binary format for css as well, I might work on it someday if I feel like it.
